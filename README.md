Applying Matrix ALGorithms Against Monoids

This repository contains tools for analysis and classification
of formal languages based on sparse matrix representations.
The syntactic monoid (or semigroup) of a pattern forms a basis
for most classification problems.

This software is a work in progress.
It is not currently suitable for production use.
